 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 It also includes the "service", "invoke-rc.d", and "update-rc.d" scripts which
 provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping
 services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.
 .
 While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT
 specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to
 include their helpers in this package.

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression
 The supported formats are:
  * DEFLATE (raw)
  * zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
  * gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)
 .
 libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster than the zlib
 library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
 processors. In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
 that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".

Description: high-performance event loop library modelled after libevent
 libev provides a full-featured and high-performance event loop that is
 loosely modelled after libevent. It includes relative timers, absolute
 timers with customized rescheduling, synchronous signals, process status
 change events, event watchers dealing with the event loop itself, file
 watchers, and even limited support for fork events. It uses a priority
 queue to manage timers and uses arrays as fundamental data structure. It
 has no artificial limitations on the number of watchers waiting for the
 same event.
 .
 libev supports select, poll, epoll, kqueue, and inotify.

 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.

 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: High-priority task queue for Node.js and browsers
 This module executes a task after the scheduled tasks are over
 .
 ASAP strives to schedule events to occur before yielding for IO, reflow, or
 redrawing. ASAP provides a fast event queue that will execute tasks until it
 is empty before yielding to the JavaScript engine's underlying event-loop.
 When a task gets added to a previously empty event queue, ASAP schedules a
 flush event, preferring for that event to occur before the JavaScript engine
 has an opportunity to perform IO tasks or rendering, thus making the first
 task and subsequent tasks semantically indistinguishable. ASAP uses a
 variety of techniques to preserve this invariant on different versions of
 browsers and Node.js

 Specifically, this 'Agent' implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
 server and issues the CONNECT, which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP
 connection to the destination server.
 .
 Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
 protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).

 This module is an incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit)
 hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on Gary Court's implementation with
 kazuyukitanimura's modifications.
 .
 This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if
 you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string
 concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version)
 is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about
 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Description: Safely pass strings through shells - Node.js module
 A Node.js module that provides a simple and platform-agnostic way
 to build shell commands with arguments that pass through your shell
 unaltered and with no unsafe side effects, whether you are running
 on Windows or a Unix-based OS.
 .
 It is useful when launching a child process from Node.js using a shell
 (as with child_process.exec); in that case you have to construct your
 command as a single string instead of using an array of arguments.
 And doing that can be buggy (if not dangerous) if you don't take care
 to quote any arguments correctly for the shell you're targeting, and
 the quoting has to be done differently on Windows and non-Windows shells.

 IEEE Std 1002.1-2001, a.k.a. POSIX.1-2001, and return the
 number of columns used to represent a wide character and
 string on fixed-width output devices like terminals.
 Markus's implementation assumes wide characters to be
 encoded in ISO 10646, which is almost true for JavaScript;
 almost because JavaScript uses UCS-2 and has problems
 with surrogate pairs. wcwidth.js converts surrogate pairs
 to Unicode code points to handle them correctly.

Description: evented I/O for V8 javascript - runtime executable
 Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily
 building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an
 event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and
 efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run
 across distributed devices.
 .
 Node.js is bundled with several useful libraries to handle server
 tasks:
 .
 System, Events, Standard I/O, Modules, Timers, Child Processes, POSIX,
 HTTP, Multipart Parsing, TCP, DNS, Assert, Path, URL, Query Strings.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.

 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: simple argparse wrapper (Python 3)
 Argh provides a very simple wrapper for argparse.
 .
 Argparse is a very powerful tool; argh just makes it easy to use.
 .
 Here’s a list of features that argh adds to argparse:
 .
  * mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before
    the parser is instantiated;
  * nested commands made easy: no messing with subparsers;
  * infer command name from function name;
  * infer argument type from the default value;
  * infer argument action from the default value (for booleans);
  * infer arguments from function signature;
  * add an alias root command help for the --help argument;
  * enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of
    an argparse.Namespace object.
 .
 Argh is fully compatible with argparse. You can mix argh-agnostic and
 argh-aware code. Just keep in mind that dispatch() does some extra
 work that a custom dispatcher may not do.
 .

Description: simplify usage of Python decorators by programmers
 Python 2.4 decorators have significantly changed the way Python programs are
 structured.
    * decorators help reduce boilerplate code;
    * decorators help the separation of concerns;
    * decorators enhance readability and maintainability;
    * decorators are very explicit.
 Still, as of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires some
 experience and is not as easy as it could be. For instance, typical
 implementations of decorators involve nested functions and we all know that
 flat is better than nested.
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators for
 the average programmer and to popularize decorators usage giving examples of
 useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing, redirecting_stdout, locked, etc.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible
 the ElementTree API, trying to avoid inventing too many new APIs,
 or the user's having to learn new things -- XML is complicated enough.

Description: Python3 API to manipulate OpenDocument files
 Odfpy is a library to read and write OpenDocument v. 1.1 files.
 The main focus has been to prevent the programmer from creating invalid
 documents. It has checks that raise an exception if the programmer adds
 an invalid element, adds an attribute unknown to the grammar, forgets to
 add a required attribute or adds text to an element that doesn't allow it.
 .
 These checks and the API itself were generated from the RelaxNG
 schema, and then hand-edited. Therefore the API is complete and can
 handle all ODF constructions.
 .
 In addition to the API, there are a few scripts:
 .
  - csv2ods - Create OpenDocument spreadsheet from comma separated values
  - mailodf - Email ODF file as HTML archive
  - odf2xhtml - Convert ODF to (X)HTML
  - odf2mht - Convert ODF to HTML archive
  - odf2xml - Create OpenDocument XML file from OD? package
  - odfimgimport - Import external images
  - odflint - Check ODF file for problems
  - odfmeta - List or change the metadata of an ODF file
  - odfoutline - Show outline of OpenDocument
  - odfuserfield - List or change the user-field declarations in an ODF file
  - xml2odf - Create OD? package from OpenDocument in XML form

Description: Python 3 module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python3 programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.

 In contrast to the python-qrencode module this module does not need
 an additional C library.
 .
 In addition this package provides a command line tool to generate QR
 codes and either write these QR codes to a file or do the output
 as ascii art at the console.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.

Description: ReportLab library to create PDF documents using Python3
 ReportLab is a library that lets you directly create documents in
 Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Python programming language.
 .
 ReportLab library creates PDF based on graphics commands without
 intervening steps. It's therefore extremely fast, and flexible (since
 you're using a full-blown programming language).
 .
 Sample use cases are:
   * Dynamic PDF generation on the web
   * High-volume corporate reporting and database publishing
   * As embeddable print engine for other applications, including a
     'report language' so that users can customize their own reports.
   * As 'build system' for complex documents with charts, tables and text
     such as management accounts, statistical reports and scientific papers
   * from XML to PDF in one step

Description: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text (Python 3 module)
 It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
 it in ASCII for display. One could represent non-roman Unicode characters as
 "???" or "\\15BA\\15A0\\1610", but neither is useful to the user reading the
 text.
 .
 Unidecode tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
 displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
 when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
 with a US keyboard would choose.
 .
 This module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents
 from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is
 based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
 approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
 .
 unidecode is a Python 3 port of the Text::Unidecode Perl module.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or
 small screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xfonts-utils package to prepare the font
 directories for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
